**Experiment No.: 03**

**Aim:** To study and implement bare-metal virtualization using Xen Server.

**Theory/Working Principle:**

In the realm of server virtualization, bare-metal virtualization refers to the direct installation of virtualization software onto the hardware without an intermediary operating system. This setup, also known as a bare-metal server, allows for enhanced performance and security by eliminating layers between the virtualization software and the hardware.

Examples of bare-metal virtualization software include Citrix Hypervisor (XenServer), VMware ESXi, and Microsoft Hyper-V. These systems provide a dedicated environment for each tenant, ensuring optimal performance and resource allocation.

**Procedure:**

1. **XenServer System Requirements:** Ensure the availability of XenServer 7 ISO and a server capable of virtualization. Refer to the hardware compatibility list for compatibility verification.

2. **Fresh Installation of XenServer 7:**
   - Download the XenServer ISO file from the provided link.
   - Copy the ISO file to a USB drive using the 'dd' utility to create a bootable USB drive.
   - Insert the bootable USB drive into the target system and boot from it.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to select the installation language, accept the End User License Agreement (EULA), and choose the installation type (clean install or upgrade).
   - Specify the installation drive and source, and verify the installation files.
   - Set up system information including the root password, network configuration, hostname, DNS, timezone, and NTP.
   - Proceed with the installation, ensuring all data on the target disks will be erased.
   - Upon successful installation, the system will boot into the XenServer console.

3. **Installation of XenCenter in Windows:**
   - Download the XenCenter installer and launch the installation process.
   - Once installed, launch XenCenter and add the XenServer host(s) by providing the IP address or hostname along with the authentication credentials.
   - Upon successful authentication, the XenServer(s) will be displayed in the left panel of XenCenter for management.

**Conclusion:**

Bare-metal virtualization, exemplified by XenServer, offers enhanced performance and security by directly installing virtualization software onto the hardware. Through a step-by-step process, including fresh installation and setup of XenServer, along with the installation of XenCenter for management, a robust virtualization environment can be established, providing efficient resource utilization and simplified management.
