**Experiment No.: 01**

**Aim:** 
Study of NIST (National Institute of Standard & Technology) model of Cloud Computing.
(Understand deployment models, Service models, Advantages of Cloud Computing)

**Theory/Working Principle:**

Cloud Computing refers to manipulating, configuring, and accessing hardware and software resources remotely. It offers online data storage, infrastructure, and applications. Cloud computing provides platform independency, making business applications mobile and collaborative. Key features include on-demand self-service, resource pooling, measured service, and rapid elasticity.

**NIST MODEL**

**Types of Cloud:**

**Public Cloud**
Accessible to the general public, less secure due to openness.
Example: Amazon Web Service, Microsoft Azure.

**Private Cloud**
Accessible within an organization, more secure due to privacy.
Example: College facilities.

**Community Cloud**
Accessible by a group of organizations.
Example: Facebook.

**Hybrid Cloud**
Mixture of public and private cloud, critical activities on private cloud, non-critical on public cloud.

**Service Models:**

Cloud computing is based on three service models:

1. **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS):** Provides fundamental resources like physical and virtual machines.
Example: Amazon EC2.

2. **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):** Provides runtime environment, development, and deployment tools.
Example: Azure.

3. **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):** Allows using software applications as a service.
Example: Owncloud, Amazon S3.

**Cloud Cube Model:**

Designed by Jericho forum, it categorizes cloud networks based on four dimensions:

1. Internal/External (Physical Location of Data)
2. Proprietary/Open (Ownership)
3. De-Perimeterized/Perimeterized (Security Range)
4. Insourced/Outsourced.

**1. Internal/External:**
Internal: Resources are hosted within your own physical boundaries.
External: Resources are hosted outside your physical boundaries.

**2. Proprietary/Open:**
The proprietary dimension means that the organization providing the service secures and protects the data under their ownership. The open dimension involves technology with multiple suppliers, allowing users to share data and collaborate with selected partners freely.

**3. Perimeterized/De-perimeterized:**
Perimeterized dimension involves operating within traditional IT boundaries, often signaled by network firewalls. De-perimeterized dimension follows principles outlined in the Jericho forums, where the system perimeter is architected to encapsulate data with metadata and mechanisms, enhancing data protection and limiting inappropriate usage.

**4. Insourced/Outsourced:**
In the outsourced dimension, services are provided by third parties. In the insourced dimension, services are provided by the organization's own staff under their control.

**Conclusion:**

The Cloud Cube Model aids in selecting secure cloud formations, emphasizing encryption and key management for confidentiality and integrity. It benefits users by providing a secure environment, challenging traditional notions of network boundaries. Understanding cloud models and dimensions is crucial for effective deployment and management in modern computing environments.
