Experiment No.: 02

Aim:
The aim of this experiment is to study and implement virtualization using VirtualBox, focusing on understanding different types of virtualization, host and bare-metal hypervisors, and implementing horizontal scalability.

Theory/Working Principle:
Virtualization is a technology that allows servers, workstations, storage, and other systems to become independent of physical hardware, thus reducing costs and energy consumption. It is a foundational element of cloud computing, enabling the delivery of shared computing resources, software, or data over the Internet on-demand.

Objectives of Virtualization:
1. Increased use of hardware resources
2. Reduced management and resource costs
3. Improved business flexibility
4. Improved security and reduced downtime

Virtualization Benefits:
1. More flexible and efficient allocation of resources
2. Enhanced development productivity
3. Lower cost of IT infrastructure
4. Remote access and rapid scalability
5. High availability and disaster recovery
6. Pay-per-use of IT infrastructure on demand
7. Enables running multiple operating systems

Types of Virtualization:
1. Application Virtualization
2. Network Virtualization
3. Desktop Virtualization
4. Storage Virtualization
5. Server Virtualization
6. Data Virtualization

VirtualBox Installation Steps:
1. Download the Ubuntu ISO file from [ubuntu.com](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
2. Download VirtualBox from [virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

Experiment Procedure:
1. Install VirtualBox by following the provided setup instructions.
2. Customize the setup options as required, including RAM, CPU cores, and virtual hard disk.
3. Complete the VirtualBox setup and launch the application.
4. Configure the virtual machine settings, including RAM allocation, CPU cores, and storage.
5. Install Ubuntu as a virtual machine using the downloaded ISO file.
6. Follow the installation prompts to complete the Ubuntu installation process.
7. Upon successful installation, the Ubuntu virtual machine will be ready for use.

Conclusion:
Virtualization using VirtualBox offers numerous benefits, including resource optimization, cost reduction, and increased flexibility. By understanding different types of virtualization and implementing them using tools like VirtualBox, organizations can achieve greater efficiency and scalability in their IT infrastructure.
